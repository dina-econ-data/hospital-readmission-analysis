# Hospital Readmission Analysis

This project explores patient profiles associated with hospital readmission using multivariate statistical methods.

## Context
Hospital readmissions are a major concern for healthcare systems, as they may indicate issues related to patient management, treatment effectiveness, or post-discharge care. Identifying patient profiles associated with higher readmission risk can help improve healthcare planning and resource allocation.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to identify and characterize patient profiles associated with hospital readmission using interpretable statistical techniques.

## Data
The analysis is based on a public healthcare dataset containing anonymized patient-level information related to hospital admissions and readmissions.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- Hierarchical clustering (CAH)  
- k-means clustering  

## Tools
- R  
- RStudio  
- R Markdown  
- FactoMineR  
- factoextra  

## Expected Outcomes
This analysis aims to highlight distinct patient profiles and explore their relationship with hospital readmission patterns, providing insights that could support data-driven decision-making in healthcare contexts.

## Project Status
This project is currently in progress.
